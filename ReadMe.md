## [Working Methodology](#working-methodology)

In order to achieve this release, i determined tasks having in mind an Agile mindset and stablishing goals to be completed within weekly iterations.

Placing myself in the user's position, and anticipating the user's wants and needs, i made myself the following questions:

- Why would a user want to visit our blog? 
- What will make them return?
- What do i want to see when I visit a blog What would make me return

From those answers I did set up 5 issues in GitHub as User Stories.
